This is an obscenely simple program to add the UTC time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as the network that I
work on uses UTC Time exclusively for all of our devices. Converting
in my head was a true pain.

The latest version is 1.0a for Mac OS 10.7 (only), downloadable from
GitHub in the Downloads section:

https://github.com/netik/UTCMenuClock/downloads

If you need a Universal Binary, compile the source; I've updated the
configuration to build for both.

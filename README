This is an obscenely simple program to add the UTC time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as the network that I
work on uses UTC Time exclusively for all of our devices. Converting
in my head was a true pain.

The latest version is 1.0a, downloadable from GitHub via this Link:

Uses LaunchController, which is Copyright (c) 2010 Ben Clark-Robinson,

Compiled under XCode 4 and MacOS 10.7.
